Purpose
-------  
I've simply modified the original code in order to better understand it, and add readability, reusability and better error messages

Quick Start
-----------  
Download bizhawk: https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk   
Download ROM for game (E.G SMW)  
Run the game, and create a `.state` file, at the beginning of the level, give it a name and save it to `/asserts/savedstates/nameoffile.state`  
Change the `saveFileName` inside `NEATEvolve_2.lua` to have the filename E.G: `saveFileName = SMW.state`  
Run Lua script: `source/NEATEvolv_2.lua` in Bizhawk  





Properties
----------
Properties can be found at the beginning of the main file;
